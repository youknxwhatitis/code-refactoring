# code-refactoring

## Objective


Tasked by my company to make an accessible codebase that meets the requirements for most optimal search engines. To make it more optimal I applied elements such semantic tags, and alt attributes to make it user-friendly. Created a structure outlining all the html elements in the previous code. Configure selectors to make them less redundant. Included comments for better analyzation of the code that was refactored.
